The method encodes the 2D drawing as a raster image and uses a standard ViT model for input. It then auto-regressively predicts a general-purpose language describing the 3D parametric model in text form. The output is a text-based representation that is more flexible and can be easily extended to arbitrary geometric entities and semantic or functional properties. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset of cabinet models demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.',\n",

Recent learning-based approaches, such as PlankAssembly, have emerged as an alternative, but have limitations including requiring exactly three axis-aligned views as input and dealing with a single type of primitive. In contrast, sequence modeling for CAD has proposed domain-specific languages and trained deep networks to generate CAD models auto-regressively, but most methods learn domain-specific sequence representations.',\n",

            "   - The first operation is a **MatMul** (matrix multiplication) between Q and K, producing a score.\n",
            "   - This score is then passed to a **Scale** component, which adjusts the magnitude of the scores.\n",
            "   - An optional **Mask** is applied next to prevent certain positions from being attended to, often used in tasks like language modeling.\n",
            "   - The scores are then passed through a **SoftMax** layer to convert them into probabilities.\n",

            "   - It begins with three linear transformations applied to V, K, and Q, indicated by three **Linear** blocks.\n",
            "   - These transformed vectors are then processed by the **Scaled Dot-Product Attention** block (highlighted in purple).\n",
            "   - The outputs from multiple attention heads are concatenated using the **Concat** operation.\n",

Use of the solvent add-back module allows for the addition of solvent laden sheath gas to the virtual impactor. The solvent laden gas is used to saturate the atomized aerosol, preventing blockage of the virtual impactor as a result of material drying. Similarly, dry VI sheath gas flow is used to protect the walls of the VI jet and collector from particle impaction and build-up when using an ink that does not require solvent add-back. Set the VI sheath flow rate in KEWA Process Control.\\n\\n9.4 Printing\\n\\n1. Verify standoff height.\\n\\n2.
