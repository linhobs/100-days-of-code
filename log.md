# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 15, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: I made a decision to join the 100daysofcode challenge, I posted on my status and Bernice is also willing to commit 

**Thoughts:** I have really longed for long to be a world class software developer but I have not been very consistent and have played around for way too long. I have therefore made a decision to now fully commit time and resources into becoming. I do android and web applications development with laravel but now I will be committing to freecodecamp's course. I also have to learn the MERN stack as requirements for my work as Teaching assistant. so I will do only two for the challenge whiles doing other personal stuff and TA duties.

**main focus**
1.[freecodecamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)
2.Learn the MERN STACK: find available reources

my Php and laravue tutorials will follow during my grind time and long hours
